# EXPERIMENTAL REMOVAL - Testing if these secrets are actually used
#
# Research findings (2025-11-27):
# - AgentBuilds run in TENANT namespaces (team1, team2), NOT kagenti-system
# - Code verification shows secrets are loaded from agentBuild.Namespace
# - No grep matches for kagenti-system secrets being referenced by any code
# - Comments claimed "for AgentBuilds in kagenti-system" but that pattern doesn't exist
#
# This file is temporarily disabled to verify secrets are truly unused.
# If CI passes, these secrets will be permanently removed.
# If CI fails, we'll investigate what actually uses them.
#
# Original secrets that were here:
# - github-token-secret (namespace: kagenti-system)
# - ghcr-secret (namespace: kagenti-system)
# - openai-secret (namespace: kagenti-system)
# - quay-registry-secret (namespace: kagenti-system)
#
# Tenant namespace secrets remain active in agent-namespaces.yaml

# Intentionally empty - secrets removed for testing
