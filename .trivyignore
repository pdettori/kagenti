# DS-0002: Base images intentionally don't include USER directives
# The python12 Dockerfile is a base image meant to be extended by other Dockerfiles.
# Child images need to run as root to install packages before adding their own USER directive.

# KSV046, KSV041, KSV044: HyperShift CI ClusterRole RBAC permissions
# The k8s-ci-clusterrole.yaml has documented security notes explaining why broad permissions
# are required:
# 1. Kubernetes RBAC doesn't support namespace prefix wildcards
# 2. HyperShift dynamically creates control plane namespaces (clusters-<name>)
# 3. The operator, not CI, creates these namespaces so we can't pre-create RoleBindings
# 4. Permissions are minimized to specific resources (not wildcards)
# See file comments for full security analysis: .github/scripts/hypershift/policies/k8s-ci-clusterrole.yaml
# These may trigger: wildcard verbs, create secrets, delete pods, etc.
