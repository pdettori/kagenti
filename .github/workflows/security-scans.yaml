# Security Scans - Comprehensive security checks from TODO_IMPORTANT_GH_ACTIONS.md
#
# Phases implemented:
# - Phase 0: Gitleaks (commented - needs license), Dependency Review, Shellcheck
# - Phase A: Stricter dependency review, YAML lint, Helm lint
# - Phase B: Python security (Bandit)
# - Phase C: Container/IaC (Hadolint, Trivy)
# - Phase D: CodeQL, Action pinning (OpenSSF Scorecard in separate workflow)
#
# These scans run on pull_request (not pull_request_target), so they:
# - Use the workflow file from the PR branch (works without stub PR)
# - Do NOT have access to secrets (safe for fork PRs)
# - Run automatically on all PRs
#
# Token/License Requirements:
# - Gitleaks: Requires GITLEAKS_LICENSE for org repos (free at gitleaks.io for OSS)
# - CodeQL: Free for public repos on GitHub.com (no token needed)
# - Trivy: Free, no token needed
# - Bandit/Hadolint: Free, open source (Apache 2.0 / GPL-3)
# - OpenSSF Scorecard: See .github/workflows/scorecard.yaml (separate workflow)
