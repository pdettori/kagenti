# Post-Merge Security Scan - Full repository vulnerability scan after merge to main
#
# This workflow runs the blocking Trivy filesystem scan that was made
# informational on PRs (to avoid blocking unrelated changes with
# pre-existing vulnerabilities).
#
# PR workflow (security-scans.yaml) handles:
# - Dependency Review: catches NEW vulnerable/GPL dependencies
# - Trivy fs scan: informational only (shows issues, doesn't block)
# - Trivy config scan: blocks on IaC misconfigurations (PR-specific)
#
# This workflow handles:
# - Full Trivy fs scan on the merged codebase (never fails)
# - Uploads SARIF results to GitHub Security tab (code-scanning alerts)
