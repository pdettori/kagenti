# OpenSSF Scorecard - Security health metrics for Open Source
#
# Measures repository security posture and provides recommendations.
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab and OpenSSF Scorecard API.
#
# NOTE: Scorecard only works on 'schedule' and 'push' triggers, NOT 'pull_request'
# This is a GitHub/Scorecard limitation for result publishing.
# See: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action#workflow-restrictions
#
# Token Requirements:
# - No external tokens needed
# - Uses GITHUB_TOKEN for API access
# - id-token: write needed for OIDC verification when publishing results
#
# Reference: https://securityscorecards.dev/
