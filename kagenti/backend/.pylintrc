[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the following checks:
# E0401: import-error (dependencies not installed during lint)
# R0903: too-few-public-methods (Pydantic models don't need methods)
# R0801: duplicate-code (some duplication is acceptable in routers)
# W1203: logging-fstring-interpolation (f-strings in logging are fine for this project)
# R0913: too-many-arguments (FastAPI handlers often have many params)
# R0917: too-many-positional-arguments (FastAPI handlers often have many params)
# C0301: line-too-long (handled by formatter)
# W0707: raise-missing-from (acceptable in HTTP exception handlers)
# C2801: unnecessary-dunder-call (async context managers)
# W1309: f-string-without-interpolation (minor style issue)
# R1705: no-else-return (style preference)
# W0621: redefined-outer-name (common in FastAPI lifespan)
# W0613: unused-argument (common in FastAPI lifespan)
# R0914: too-many-locals (complex functions in routers)
# R0912: too-many-branches (complex async handlers)
# R0915: too-many-statements (complex async handlers)
# R1702: too-many-nested-blocks (async streaming code)
# R1724: no-else-continue (style preference)
# C0415: import-outside-toplevel (lazy imports for optional deps)
# W0718: broad-exception-caught (acceptable in error handlers)
# C0116: missing-function-docstring (property methods)
# W0603: global-statement (used for singleton pattern)
# E1101: no-member (false positives with async generators)
# C0103: invalid-name (private module-level variables)
