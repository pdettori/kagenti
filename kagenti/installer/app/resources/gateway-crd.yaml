          MCPServer defines a collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to be aggregated by the gateway.
          It enables discovery and federation of tools from multiple backend MCP servers through HTTPRoute references,
          providing a declarative way to configure which MCP servers should be accessible through the gateway.
